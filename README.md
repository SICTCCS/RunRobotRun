Modifications to the Robot Run Game

For full points, you MUST follow these steps to set up your repo correctly.
1. Create 4 directories, one for each revision of the project.  You should call them Rev1, Rev2, etc
2. Download starter code from Activity 1.1.5 and place it in Rev1.
3. Each folder should place all image files in a subfolder called `assets` (When you do this, you will need to modify the starter code to access these files)
